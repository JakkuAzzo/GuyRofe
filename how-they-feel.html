            The successor to "We're all alone in this together". I turned the instant camera toward the public, asking strangers,
            friends, and teammates to show me the feeling they were carrying that day. Each frame is unplanned, raw, and the start of
            a brief connection.

              The successor to "We're all alone in this together", How They Feel is a multi-year project capturing people's
              feelings using instant cameras. Having photographed my own story previously, it felt necessary to turn the camera to the
              public and invite them to share the weight they were carrying.
            </p>
            <p>
              I carried the camera everywhere: on the Tube, courtside, backstage, and through training grounds. Anyone willing to
              pause was given a frame and the space to describe their state of mind. Over time that openness built a huge archive —
              five full albums of small, honest confessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              They're more than photos. Each is a moment of vulnerability, a pocket of expression when someone can get something off
              their chest. Some encounters lasted seconds, others an entire journey, but together they add to a wider portrait of how
              people feel right now.

              <strong>Above is a small sample.</strong> The full installation mixes scans, handwritten notes, and audio clips from
              participants, presented as a tactile wall that can travel to galleries, clubs, and supporter spaces.

                Touring exhibitions, editorial features, and brand collaborations are available. Instant film stations can be set up
                on-site so guests leave with a tangible print and a story logged in the archive.
